# Predicting Boston House Prices using Neural Nets
I am using the Housing dataset which contains information about different houses in Boston. This data was originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been removed now. We can also access this data from the scikit-learn library. There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.I have used a Neural Network with no output activation function since the prediction should have linearity.

There are very less number of training samples provided and hence I went with a rather simple Neural Network with 2 layers and 64 hidden units.
The less number of training samples might cause overfitting
